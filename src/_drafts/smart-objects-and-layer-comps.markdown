I have to mention you will need photoshop CC 2014 for this to work. So let's see how we can combine smart objects with layer comps to speed up our design process. I will use [Linked Smart Objects][link-smart-objects] because are stored as a separate file, so they can be shared amongst many photoshop documents.

[Layer Comps][layer-comps] are in photoshop for a long time but I didn't use them because seemed too difficult to manage. Let's give it a try again with this new upgrade that alow us to combine these with [Smart Objects][smart-objects], to be more specific I will use this with [Link Smart Objects][link-smart-objects] and not Embedded Smart Objects.

I will reproduce the navigation from my website and I will use [Link Smart Objects][link-smart-objects] and [Layer Comps][layer-comps] to present the states for each page.

Let's start with a new document, you can use Cmd + N to crea a new document
